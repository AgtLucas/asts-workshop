# Schedule

Just something to help me make sure that I cover everything I want to in the
right order.

## Getting Started

- Introductions
  - Setup expectations
  - Go over logistics

## Why ASTs?

Go over [these slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/a-beginners-guide-to-asts#/3).

> NOTE: only look at the ESLint example to start!
